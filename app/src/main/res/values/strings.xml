The software is written in the Swift programming language or Objective-C and then deployed to the App Store for users to download. If youâ€™re aÂ mobile app developer, you may have had reservations about iOS development. For example, each developer needs a Mac computerâ€”and Macs are generally more expensive than their Windows-based counterparts. In addition, once you complete your app, it faces a stringent quality review process before it can be distributed through the App Store.]]></string>

It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.</string>

    <string name="frontend_BackendAnalysis">-> Front End and Back End: Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web development. These terms are very crucial for web development but are quite different from each other. Each side needs to communicate and operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the websiteâ€™s functionality.</string>
    <string name="frontEnd_Analysis">-> Front End Development: The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the â€˜client sideâ€™ of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. The structure, design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End developers. Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.</string>

    <string name="backend_Analysis">Backend Development: Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.</string>

The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend. On the other hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend. Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS, JavaScript while those used for the backend include Java, Ruby, Python, .Net.</string>

To develop this application, Android Studio is required. For programming, Java||Kotlin||ReactNative and XML will be required in Android Studio. For fake calling, you need to get access to the CallManager package in Your Respective Selected Language. The user would need to make an account and set the caller name in the application.
